    <p><strong>About Me</strong></p>
    <p>I study math at Harvard, with a particular interest in probability. Some of my favorite courses have been Math 55A (Studies in Algebra & Group Theory) and OEB 242 (Population Genetics). I was named a John Harvard Scholar, which honors the top 5% of each class by GPA, and was a course assistant for Math 154 (Probability Theory) during spring 2025.</p>
    
    <p>I'm also interested in investing from both systematic and fundamental perspectives. I interned on Yin Luo's quantitative research group (QES) at Wolfe Research during summer 2025, where I applied deep learning algorithms to systematic options trading strategies. At Harvard, I serve as Vice President of a long-short investment fund, where I've pitched mainly consumer stocks. I'm also active in trading competitions, which are a natural extension of my interest in math.</p>
    
    <p>Additionally, I'm very interested in the natural world, having raised tropical fish, reptiles, various invertebrates, and plants for most of my life. Some highlights include creating a world's first carnivorous pitcher plant (<em>Nepenthes</em>) hybrid, growing desert leafcutter ant (<em>Acromyrmex versicolor</em>) colonies in my room during high school, and surveying harvester ants (<em>Pogonomyrmex barbatus</em>) in the Chiricahua desert with the Gordon Lab at Stanford University during summer 2024.</p>
    
    <p>I'm also a musician, and my program bio is below:</p>
    
    <p><strong>Music Bio</strong></p>
    <p>Reade Park, described as "a rare and wonderful talent" by guitar luminary Sharon Isbin, is a musician from San Francisco, California. The First Prize winner at the Guitar Foundation of America's International Youth Competition, Reade received Second Prize in the Boston GuitarFest and University of Rhode Island International Open-Division Competitions, and is a two-time National YoungArts Foundation Award Winner.

    <p>As a composer, Reade received Harvard University's John Green Prize, 1st Prize in the San Francisco Conservatory of Music's Kris Getz Competition, and was a Finalist for the ASCAP Morton Gould Awards. Reade also performs and tours as a singer with the Harvard Callbacks, recently qualifying for Quarterfinals at the International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella. His debut arrangement and performance of the Arctic Monkeys' "Baby I'm Yours" rendition garnered viral acclaim (12M+ views across platforms).</p>
    
    <p>Currently enrolled in the Harvard-NEC Dual-Degree Program, Reade is pursuing an A.B. in mathematics and an M.M. in classical guitar under Eliot Fisk. He was elected Treasurer for Harvard's Signet Society for Arts & Letters. Reade previously studied at the San Francisco Conservatory of Music's Pre-College Academy and his mentors include JudicaÃ«l Perroy, Scott Cmiel, Matthew Cmiel, Mark Simons, and Robert Chastain.</p>
